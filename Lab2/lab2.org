* Electronic Structure Calculations using =GAMESS= and =Avogadro=

In this lab session we will learn how to run and visualize the results of electronic structure calculations utilizing the GAMESS and Avogadro software on the CRC machines.

** Logging In

You should all be familiar with how to login to the CRC front end machine.

- Windows users using putty, open it and login.

- For Mac and Linux users, and for windows users using MobaXterm,

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh -Y yournetid@crcfe01.crc.nd.edu
#+END_SRC

** Loading the required modules

- The shell command ~module avail~ shows a list of software installed on the CRC machines which you can load and use

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
module avail
#+END_SRC


- The modules we will need to load are ~avogadro~, ~gamess~, and ~openbabel~.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
module load avogadro
module load gamess
module load openbabel
#+END_SRC

** Avogadro

- To launch avogadro type

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
avogadro &
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- We are going to set up and run a calculation for N_{2}

- In the draw settings section select nitrogen from the element drop down menu

- Uncheck adjust hydrogens (this will put hydrogens on your atom and construct NH_{3})

- Clicking in the view window will create a nitrogen atom

- Place two nitrogen atoms next to each other to make a N_{2} molecule

- Hovering over any of the icons in the top bar will display a description of that option.

- The click to measure tool will allow you to measure distances (select two atoms) and angles (select 3 atoms). Select both nitrogens, #1 and #2 will appear on them and the distance will be displayed below

- Click on the manipulation tool (the hand with a finger pointing)

- Click and drag one of the nitrogens until the bond length is 1.1 ËšA (later we will learn methods for optimizing geometry, but for right now we will set it based on the experimental distance http://cccbdb.nist.gov/exp2.asp?casno=7727379)

** =GAMESS=

*** Creating Input files

- We are ready to generate our input file now. From the extensions menu select =GAMESS= and click on =Input Generator=

- A window will pop-up. The setup for this calculation right now is a single point energy calculation, the method is restricted Hartree-Fock, with the STO-3G basis. In the lower right click generate

- Name your input file and save it in a new folder

- Alternately, you could also have typed in the input file by hand 

*** Running calculations

- Go back to the terminal cd into the directory where you saved the input file

- The command below will run games on your input file and generate an output file called =N2.log=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rungms N2.inp > N2.log
#+END_SRC



*** Analyzing the output

- Open the output file in a text editor 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs N2.log &
#+END_SRC

- The structure of the output file is
  - summary of the input
  - initialization messages
  - store 1 and 2 electron integrals
  - SCF calculation details
  - final orbital populations and energies

- Now go back to Avogadro and open the log file

- From here you can view the orbitals and their energies

- You can also measure any angles and bond lengths in the same manner as we did when setting up the input calculation
