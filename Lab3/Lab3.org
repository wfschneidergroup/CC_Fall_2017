* A review of what we know

So far we have learned how to:

- navigate the linux terminal

- create create and edit files using Emacs

- numerical analysis and plotting with Python

- different concepts in molecular simulations, e.g. potential energy surfaces, geometry optimizations, etc.

It might make sense to go back and read the lecture notes and notes from Lab 1 and Lab 2 if you feel the need to re-familiarize yourself with these things. In this lab, we will combine some of the things we learned and to perform DFT calculations with a powerful software package, =VASP=. 


* Loading the required software

Before we can actually proceed, we will need to tell our computer how it can find all the tools we need. We will store this information so that the software is already loaded for us every time we login in the future. Depending on your unix shell, the things we need to do will be a little different. You can see which shell you are using with the command ~echo $0~. 

The software we need is dependent on the bash shell and thus we (all users) need to add a few commands to our ~.bashrc~ file. Go to your home directory and open the =.bashrc= file, i.e., run the following two commands. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd
emacs .bashrc
#+END_SRC

Once there, add the following line at the bottom of the file and save it (Make sure there are no typos!).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
source /afs/crc.nd.edu/user/w/wschnei1/CBE547/software/course_bashrc.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

If there is a line that says ~module load ase~ in your file, remove it.

For tsch users, there is an additional step. Go to the terminal and run,

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd
emacs .cshrc
#+END_SRC

Once there, add the following line at the bottom of the file and save it (Make sure there are no typos!). 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
source /afs/crc.nd.edu/user/w/wschnei1/CBE547/software/course_cshrc.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

If there is a line that says ~module load ase~ in your file, remove it.

*Now logout and log back in*. Once this is done, go to computational-chemistry/Lab3/ and open it Lab3.org in emacs.


* Introduction to Software

=VASP= or the Vienna ab-inito Simulation Package is a density functional theory (DFT) package that utilizes periodic boundary conditions and planewave basis sets. It was developed at the Theoretical Physics Department at the Institute for Materials Physics in Vienna, Austria. More information about =VASP= can be obtained at http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/vasp.html. We will use a combination of the =ASE= (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) and =jasp= (https://github.com/jkitchin/jasp) packages to help prepare input files, manage job submission to the queue system, and analysis of results.  

*Note: The original =jasp= code has been slightly modified to work with the Notre Dame queue system.*

Prof. J. R. Kitchin wrote a book to accompany =jasp= (http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/). It contains 100s of examples of using =jasp= for almost every kind of calculation that can be performed using =VASP=. Most of the examples in this document were from that book!

*Note: This is not the most recent version of the book, so some of the functionality might be different to reflect the most recent version of =ase=. For the most recent version go to, https://github.com/jkitchin/dft-book.*


* Creating Molecules

Molecules are defined in =ase= using something called Atoms objects, which are a combination of Atom objects (obviously!). There are various ways to create Atoms objects - by hand, reading them from files, databases, etc.

** From Scratch

We can build atoms by hand by specifying the type and position of each atom, and the unit cell the atoms are in.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.io import write
from ase.visualize import view

# define an Atoms object
atoms = Atoms([Atom('C', [0., 0., 0.]),
               Atom('O', [1.1, 0., 0.])],
              cell=(10, 10, 10))

atoms.center() # For a better visualization

print('V = {0:1.0f} Angstrom^3'.format(atoms.get_volume()))
write('images/simple-cubic-cell.png', atoms, show_unit_cell=2)
view(atoms)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: V = 1000 Angstrom^3

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 2in
[[./images/simple-cubic-cell.png]]



** Using in-built databases
   
We can load predefined molecules from ~ase.structure.molecule~. For example, the database contains the molecules in the G2 set (http://www.cse.anl.gov/OldCHMwebsiteContent/compmat/comptherm.htm) among others. These are generally the result of MP2/6-31g(d) calculations from a code like =GAUSSIAN= or =GAMESS=. Consequently, they will not have unit cell information, and will have a default unit cell of  (( 1.  0.  0.), ( 0.  1.  0.), ( 0.  0.  1.)). We need to manually specify the unit cell for a =VASP= calculation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule
from ase.visualize import view

atoms = molecule('CO')

view(atoms)
print atoms
print 'Old Cell:'
print atoms.get_cell()

atoms.set_cell((10,10,10), scale_atoms=False)
print 'New Cell:'
print atoms.get_cell()
view(atoms)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The g2 set as implemented in ase is given below.

** Reading structures from files

ASE can read a variety of data formats using ~ase.io.read~. For example, here is a cif file I downloaded from http://materialsproject.org.

[[file:mp-22862_NaCl.cif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.io import read
from ase.visualize import view

atoms = read('mp-22862_NaCl.cif')

view(atoms)
print atoms
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Atoms(symbols='Na4Cl4', positions=..., cell=[[5.69169356, 0.0, 0.0], [3.485157149990802e-16, 5.69169356, 0.0], [3.485157149990802e-16, 3.485157149990802e-16, 5.69169356]], pbc=[True, True, True])



* Simple SCF calculations

We will now perform a simple calculation on our CO molecule. This is done by creating a =jasp= calculator, which is an extension of the default Vasp calculator in ase (~ase.calculators.vasp~). The two properties that we will calculate in this example are the energy and the forces on the atoms. 

The first time we run this code, a calculation will be submitted to the Notre Dame queue system. So when you try to print the potential energy of you will get an exception saying VaspSubmitted. You can check the status of the job by going back to the terminal and typing ~qstat -u netid~. Once the job has finished running you can rerun the code, and if all went well, it should give you the energies and the forces.

We can also look at the files created by =VASP= to see if everything went ok. 



* Geometry Optimizations

Now let us try to do a geometry optimization. For this =VASP= needs two additional keywords (at least) - ~IBRION~ and ~NSW~. ~IBRION~ controls the relaxation algorithm and ~NSW~ specifies the total number of steps.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.io import write
from ase.visualize import view
from jasp import jasp

# define an Atoms object
co = Atoms([Atom('C', [0., 0., 0.]),
               Atom('O', [1.1, 0., 0.])],
              cell=(10, 10, 10))

with jasp('molecules/geometry-co',  # output dir relative to current dir
          xc='PBE',  # the exchange-correlation functional
          nbands=8,    # number of bands
          encut=350,    # planewave cutoff
          ismear=1,    # Methfessel-Paxton smearing
          sigma=0.01,  # very small smearing factor for a molecule
          nsw=20, # Number of ionic steps
          ibrion=2, # Conjugate gradient alogrithm
          atoms=co) as calc:
    print('energy = {0} eV'.format(co.get_potential_energy()))
    print 'Forces (eV/Ang.):'
    print(co.get_forces())
    print 'Equilibrium Positions (Angs.):'
    for atom in co:
        print atom.symbol, atom.position
    
# Save an image. Note that this is done outside the with statement
write('images/CO-relaxed.png', co, show_unit_cell=2, rotation='60x,-30y,90z')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We might also want to visualize the relaxation trajectory. Using the terminal, change into the directory where you performed the calculation, and type in ~jaspsum -t~.


* Effect of Unit Cell Size

Let us consider a more complicated example. Here we will vary the size of the unit cell, to see how interactions between periodic images affect the energy.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from jasp import *
from ase import Atoms,Atom
import numpy as np

atoms = Atoms([Atom('C',[0,   0, 0]),
               Atom('O',[1.2, 0, 0])])

L = [4, 5, 6, 8, 10]

energies = []

ready = True

for a in L:
    atoms.set_cell([a,a,a], scale_atoms=False)
    atoms.center()
    with jasp('molecules/co-L-{0}'.format(a),
              encut=350,
              xc='PBE',
              atoms=atoms) as calc:
        try:
            energies.append(atoms.get_potential_energy())
        except (VaspSubmitted, VaspQueued):
            ready = False

if not ready:
    import sys; sys.exit()

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(L, energies, 'bo-')
plt.xlabel('Unit cell length ($\AA$)')
plt.ylabel('Total energy (eV)')
plt.savefig('images/co-e-v.png')
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We can see that at small box sizes, there are attractive interactions between CO molecules that lower the total energy. At larger box sizes the energy starts to converge to a fixed value as the interactions are minimized. Now let's check the effect on the computational cost.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from jasp import *

L = [4, 5, 6, 8, 10]

for a in L:
    with jasp('molecules/co-L-{0}'.format(a)) as calc:
        print '{0} {1} seconds'.format(a, calc.get_elapsed_time())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4 2.616 seconds
: 5 3.907 seconds
: 6 5.891 seconds
: 8 16.588 seconds
: 10 30.543 seconds

We can see the computational cost went up by a factor of 15! Perhaps you can now appreciate the computational cost involved in simulating 100s of atoms in large boxes!




* Miscellaneous

** Building pdfs from org files

Using the software you loaded at the beginning of lab, you should be able to build a pdf from your .org files. Let us try that, click on the Org menu and click Export/Publish. Then press 'l' and 'o'. This let's you build a pdf and open it.

Alternately, you can type, ~C-c C-e l o~


** Viewing latex equations in org documents

Click on elisp:org-toggle-latex-overlays. You should be able to see the Schrodinger equation below.

- $H\psi = E\psi$
