Print information:
NWRITE = 1     ! print flag
LWAVE  =      .F.  !  write WAVECAR
LCHARG =      .T.  !  write CHGCAR
LVTOT  =      .F.  !  write LOCPOT, local potential

Set up electronic calculation
ENCUT  = 250   ! sets energy cutoff that defines basis set
PREC   = normal  ! Precision parameter, typically "normal" or "accurate"
ISPIN  = 1     ! spin polarization? 1 = no, 2 = yes
ISMEAR = 0     ! sets how orbitals are occupied. 0: Gaussian smearing, 1: M-P -5: tetrahedron
SIGMA  = 0.05 ! smearing paramater
LREAL  = auto  ! how to numerically handle core potentials.  .F.: recip  auto: real space

Electronic relaxation
ALGO  = fast   ! sets SCF algorithm.  fast: combo approach
ISTART = 0     ! start orbital calculation from scratch
INIWAV = 1     ! random guess of initial orbitals
ICHARG = 2     ! start charge density from atomic guess
EDIFF  = 1e-4  ! electronic convergence
NELM   = 30    ! maximum number of SCF cycles

Ionic relaxation
NSW    = 50    ! # of steps in optimization (default 0!)
ISIF   = 0     ! 0: relax ions, 1,2:relax ions,calc stresses, 3:relax ion+cell
IBRION = 2     ! 1: quasi-NR, 2:CG algorithm for ions
NFREE  = 10    ! number of DIIS vectors to save
POTIM  = 0.1   ! reduce trial step in optimization
EDIFFG  = -0.03

Parallelization flags
LPLANE = .T.
NPAR  = 2
