Let's look at the log file. We used 13 primitive Gaussians.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "GAUSSIAN BASIS FUNCTIONS" Ar/Ar.log
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: NUMBER OF CARTESIAN GAUSSIAN BASIS FUNCTIONS =   13

Because we used 6-31G Basis set, 6 gaussian functions are used for core shells and 3 and 1 gaussian functions are used for inner and outer regions of valance shells. See table below.

| Orbital | Basis Sets | Primitive gauss functions | Total gauss functions |
|---------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------------|
| 1s      |          1 |                         6 |                     6 |
| 2s      |          1 |                         6 |                     6 |
| 2p      |          3 |                         6 |                    18 |

| 3p      |          3 |                         3 |                     9 |

| 3p+     |          3 |                         1 |                     3 |
|---------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------------|
| Total   |         13 |                           |                    46 |

** b) How many SCF iterations does the calculation take to converge?

Let's look at the log file again. 12 iterations are required to reach convergence.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "ITER" Ar/Ar.dat
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


** c) What is the final calculated HFS/6-31G energy of the atom?

The final HFS/6-31G energy: -524.452 Hartree.

** d) What are the identities (1s, 2p, etc.) and energies of the occupied atomic orbitals?

E_FDA values are from HW2.

| Orbital | E_{GAMESS} (Hartree) | E_{FDA} (Hartree) |
|---------+----------------------+-------------------|
| 1s      |            -113.6768 |         -116.9366 |
| 2s      |             -10.7172 |          -11.6037 |
| 2p      |              -8.3677 |           -9.2721 |
| 3s      |              -0.8218 |           -1.1022 |
| 3p      |              -0.3222 |           -0.5735 |
| 3s+     |               0.4316 |                   |
| 3p+     |               0.5206 |                   |

** e) Compare your computed total energy and atomic orbital energies with those you got from Homework 2 using the fda code for Ar.

The total energy from FDA is -526.8275 Hartree. Compared to HFSs/6-31G energy (-254.425 Hartree), FDA shows slightly lower total energy.

* The Generalized Gradient Approximation

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is an improvement on Hartree-Fock-Slater that gives a nice balance between accuracy and computational expense. Using =GAMESS=, perform a single point calculation (~RUNTYP=ENERGY~) on the bent triatomic SO_{2} using the GGA (~DFTTYP=PBE~) and PC1 basis set (~GBASIS=PC1~, ~ISPHER=1~; no ~NGAUSS~ flag needed). Guess appropriate bond lengths and angle. Be sure to report your input file for your calculation.

** a) What is the spin multiplicity of SO_{2}? (Recall, the spin multiplicity is 2S +1, where S = 1/2 for one unpaired electron, S = 1 for two unpaired electrons, and so on).

The spin multiplicity for SO_{2} is 2 * 0 + 1 = 1. 

** b) How many basis functions are in this calculation?

Let's look at the log file. We used 49 primitive Gaussians.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "GAUSSIAN BASIS FUNCTIONS" SO2/SO2.log
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: NUMBER OF CARTESIAN GAUSSIAN BASIS FUNCTIONS =   49

** c) How many SCF cycles does it take to converge?

It takes 22 SCF cycles to converge.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "ITER" SO2/SO2.dat
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** d) What SCF algorithm does the code use?

The code uses the DIIS algorithm.

See log file. we can see "DIIS = T"

** e) What is the final total energy of the molecule?

The final total energy is -548.234 Hartree
    
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "TOTAL ENERGY = " SO2/SO2.log
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** f) How many occupied orbitals does the molecule have? What are the energies of the HOMO and LUMO?

There are 16 occupied orbitals.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep "NUMBER OF OCCUPIED" SO2/SO2.log
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| NUMBER | OF | OCCUPIED | ORBITALS | (ALPHA) | = | 16 |    |
| NUMBER | OF | OCCUPIED | ORBITALS | (BETA   | ) |  = | 16 |


HOMO: -0.2826 Hartree (16th)

LUMO: -0.1472 Hartree (17th)

** g) What is the final dipole moment?

The final dipole moment is 1.453 debyes

** h) What are the Mulliken gross charges on the S and O atoms?

The Mulliken charges are tabulated below.

| ATOM |    CHARGE |
|------+-----------|
| S    |  0.570174 |
| O    | -0.296290 |
| O    | -0.273884 |

** i) Plot out the electrostatic potential of SO_{2}. Which end of the molecule is electrophilic and which is nucleophilic?

The electrostatic potential can be plotted by using Avogadro.

* Geometry Optimization of SO_{2}

** a) Do a series of calculations in which you vary the S–O distances and O–S–O angle over a regular grid of values. Approximate the combination of values that give the lowest energy.

Molecular energies were calculated using Gaussian B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set:

#+ATTR_LATEX:
| Energy (Ha) | 1.35(\AA) | 1.45(\AA) | 1.50(\AA) | 1.55(\AA) | 1.65(\AA) |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 105\deg     | -548.531  | -548.574  | -548.574  | -548.565  | -548.529  |
| 115\deg     | -548.548  | -548.586  | -548.584  | -548.573  | -548.535  |
| 120\deg     | -548.550  | \textbf{-548.587} | -548.585  | -548.573  | -548.534  |
| 125\deg     | -548.549  | -548.585  | -548.583  | -548.571  | -548.532  |
| 135\deg     | -548.538  | -548.574  | -548.572  | -548.561  | -548.523  |

As shown in the table, the combination of values that give the lowest energy is S–O distance = 1.45 \AA and O–S–O angle = 120\deg.

** b) A geometry optimization is a faster way to find the optimal geometry of a molecule. Perform a geometry optimization on SO_{2} using the same computational model as above. What are the optimal S–O distances and O–S–O angle?

Geometry optimization was done using Gaussian B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set ([[./SO2.txt]]): the optimal S–O distances are 1.46 \AA and O–S–O angle is 119\deg. We got pretty close results using the rough scan.

* Other Molecules
