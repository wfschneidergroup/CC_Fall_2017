* Lectures 1-2: Review of quantum mechanics
An electron is trapped in a _one-dimensional_ box described by the potential (recall 1 bohr = 0.529177 Å, is the atomic unit of length):

    V(x)= 
\begin{cases}
    0, & -1  < x < 1  \text{ bohr} \\

a. Using the energy expression given in class, calculate the ground state (n=1) energy of the electron, in Hartree (the atomic unit of energy), in eV, and in kJ mol^{–1}.

$E = \frac{n^{2}\pi^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}L^{2}}$

For an electron in its ground state, n=1.
In atomic units \hbar = m_{e} = 1.

$E_{ground} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{(2)(2)^{2}}$
1 hartree = 27.212 eV = 2625.50 kJ mol$^{-1}$

b. We found in class that the ground-state wavefunction for this electron is $\psi_{1}(x) = cos (\pi x/2)$. Sketch this wavefunction and show that it obeys the proper boundary conditions, has zero nodes, and is normalized.

#+RESULTS:

The wavefunction plot shows zero nodes because it only intersects the x-axis at the bounds. The boundary conditions were that the wavefuction must go to zero when x is greater than 1 or less than -1, because the potential energy goes to infinity in this range. The wavefunction satisfies this as shown in the plot. We can test for normalization by taking an inner product over the bounds.

c. Suppose you approximate the true ground-state wavefunction by $\phi_{1}(x) = 1 - x^{2}$. Calculate the expectation value of the energy (in Hartree) for this approximation. How does your answer compare to the energy you calculated in (a)?

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{center}

The expectation value of total energy of the ground state electron is given as:
\left \langle E \right \rangle = \frac{{\left \langle \phi | \hat{H} | \phi \right \rangle}}{{\left \langle \phi | \phi \right \rangle}}

By approximating the true wavefunction as $\phi_{1}(x) = 1 - x^{2}$ and using the bounds x = [-1,1]:

${\left \langle \phi | \hat{H} | \phi \right \rangle} = \frac{8}{3}$ Hartree

Where $\hat{H}$ is the 1D kinetic energy operator, $-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^_{2}}{\partial x^{2}}$.

${\left \langle \phi | \phi \right \rangle} = \frac{16}{15}$ Hartree

$\left \langle E \right \rangle = \frac{5}{4} $ Hartree

\end{center}
#+END_EXPORT

Or we normalize the wavefunction first $\phi_{1}(x) = 1 - x^{2}$: $\tilde{\phi}_{1}(x)= \left(\frac{1}{\left<\phi_1|\phi_1\right>}\right)^{1/2}\phi_1$. The expectation value of the energy can then be calculated using the Hamiltonian operator as $\left<E\right> = \left<\tilde{\psi}|H|\tilde{\psi}\right>$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad

# Normalizing
def integrand(x):
    return (1 - x ** 2) ** 2

c, err = quad(integrand, -1, 1)

# The wavefunction can also be written as a polynomial
# (-1*x^2 + 0*x + 1) / sqrt(c)
p = 1 / np.sqrt(c) * np.array([-1, 0, 1])

def func(x):
    return -0.5 * 1 / np.sqrt(c) * (1 - x ** 2) * np.polyder(np.polyder(p)) # np.polyder(p) calculates the first derivative of p

E, err = quad(func, -1, 1)

print ('The expectation value of the energy is {0:.2f} hartree.'.format(E))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The expectation value of the energy is 1.25 hartree.

The energy is 1.3 % greater than the energy in part (a).

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [(d)]
d. Can you guess an even better approximate wavefunction? Guess a candidate, evaluate the expectation value of its energy, and compare to question (c). Did you do any better than my guess?

Linear combination of two functions helps to get better approximate wavefunction. The wavefunction has to obey the boundary conditions.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{center}

The expectation value of total energy of the ground state electron is given as:
\left \langle E \right \rangle = \frac{{\left \langle \phi | \hat{H} | \phi \right \rangle}}{{\left \langle \phi | \phi \right \rangle}}

By approximating the true wavefunction with the function, $\phi_{1}(x) = (1 - x^{2}) + (1 - x^{4})$, we might be able to get a more accurate energy estimation. 

${\left \langle \phi | \hat{H} | \phi \right \rangle} = \frac{716}{105}$ Hartree

${\left \langle \phi | \phi \right \rangle} = \frac{1552}{315}$ Hartree

$\left \langle E \right \rangle =  1.384$ Hartree

The new basis function did not work as well as $1 - x^{2}$. 

\end{center}
#+END_EXPORT

Another try: Let $\psi_{1}(x) = c_{1}(1-x^{2}) + c_{2}(1-x^{4})$ and set c1 = 1.2.
After normalization, we can get c2 = -0.203293.

* Lectures 3: Many-electron atoms

Hartree’s father performed the first calculations on multi-electron atoms by hand. Today those same calculations (much better ones, in fact) can be done in the blink of an eye on a computer. In this problem you will use a code first developed by Herman and Skillman in the 1960’s to calculate the wavefunctions and energy of an atom using the Hartree-Fock-Slater (HFS) model, an early predecessor to DFT. The necessary software, rewritten in =C++=, is available at ~/afs/crc.nd.edu/users/w/wschnei1/CBE547/fda.tar.gz~.

Copy the software to your home directory, unpack (~tar –xzf fda.tar.gz~), change into the directory (~cd fda~) and compile the code(~make fda~) to create the fda executable. Look at the =00README= file for information about the computer program and the format of the input. If you are brave, glance through the various source files (~*.cxx~) to get a sense of what the code is doing. Note that the code uses atomic units, Hartree for energy and bohr for distance.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [(a)]
a. Run the =Ar.inp= example included in the directory (~fda Ar~). If all goes well, you should get an output file (=Ar.out=) and a dump file (=Ar.dmp=). Look at the =Ar.out= file to answer these questions:

   - How many self-consistent field (SCF) iterations does the calculation take to converge?
    
   - What is the final calculated HFS energy of the atom?

   - What are the identities (1s, 2p, etc.) and energies of the occupied atomic orbitals?

   - What are the identities (1s, 2p, etc.) and energies of the occupied atomic orbitals?
